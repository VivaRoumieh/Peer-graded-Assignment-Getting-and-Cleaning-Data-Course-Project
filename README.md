# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, aimed at identifying human activity based on sensor data. The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, producing a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The data was originally made available here: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
## Data Source
Data for this project were obtained from the following source:
[Dataset Download Link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This dataset includes measurements from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, worn by subjects performing different activities. This analysis focuses on the mean and standard deviation measurements of each activity.

## Repository Contents
- `run_analysis.R`: This script performs the data preparation and subsequent analysis steps, creating a tidy dataset as described below.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, data transformations, and the cleaning work performed on the data.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions on how to use this repository.
- `TidyData.txt`: The output file generated by `run_analysis.R`, which contains the tidy dataset ready for further analysis.
  
## Running the Analysis
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided link and extract it in the working directory.
3. Open an R environment and set your working directory to the repository folder.
4. Source the `run_analysis.R` script: `source('run_analysis.R')`.
5. The script will automatically merge the test and training datasets, label them, and produce a tidy dataset, which will be saved as `TidyData.txt` in the working directory.
   
## Script Processing Steps
`run_analysis.R` performs the following steps to clean the data:
1. Merges the training and test datasets to create one dataset.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. From the dataset created in step 4, generates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
## Conclusion
This repository provides all the required files and instructions to understand and replicate the analysis of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset. For detailed variable descriptions and the exact transformation processes, refer to the `CodeBook.md`.
